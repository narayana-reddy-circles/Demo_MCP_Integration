**[Screen: Show the Trello integration and mention automation possibilities]**

> "And this is just the beginning. The same Trello integration we just demonstrated can be extended with automation tools like Zapier to create even more powerful workflows. Imagine when a Trello card moves to 'Completed', it automatically sends email notifications to stakeholders, updates Slack channels, creates calendar events, or triggers deployments."

> "With Zapier integration, you can connect Trello to over 5,000 other applications - from email marketing tools to CRM systems, from accounting software to communication platforms. The AI becomes not just your development assistant, but your entire business process orchestrator."

**[Screen: Show before/after comparison of manual vs automated workflow]**

> "Think about your current routine: finish coding, commit changes, update tickets, notify team members, update documentation, send status emails. Now imagine all of that happening automatically while you focus on what you do best - building great software."

> "These MCP tools transform AI from a text generator into a genuine development partner and workflow orchestrator. They bridge the gap between conversation and action, making AI assistants truly indispensable for modern development teams."

> "The future isn't just AI-assisted development - it's AI-orchestrated development workflows. Thanks for watching! If you want to set up these integrations yourself, check out the documentation I've created. Your productivity will never be the same!"

## 🎯 Key Talking Points During Recording

### Emphasize These Concepts:

1. **Real Integration**: "This isn't simulated - the AI is actually performing these actions"
2. **Live Data**: "The AI has access to current, real-time information"
3. **Workflow Automation**: "Multiple tools working together create powerful workflows"
4. **Developer Productivity**: "This saves hours of manual work"
5. **Practical Applications**: "These solve real development problems"

### Visual Cues to Capture:

- ✅ MCP tools list in Cursor settings
- ✅ AI tool calls happening in real-time
- ✅ Files being created/modified
- ✅ GitHub interface showing created issues
- ✅ Git status and commit history
- ✅ Final working application

## 🔧 Backup Demos (If Something Doesn't Work)

### If GitHub Tool Fails:
**Say instead**: "Let me show you the filesystem capabilities by creating a more complex component structure."

### If Any Tool Fails:
**Keep narrating**: "Sometimes tools have connectivity issues, but that's the reality of working with external services. Let me show you another capability..."

## 🎨 Additional Tool Reference: Figma Integration

**Note for Future Demos:**

We also have a Figma tool which can help eliminate styling issues when working with UI changes. This tool can directly fetch styles along with all properties from Figma designs. Unfortunately, I haven't added it to our today's demo as it requires a token along with the Figma mock design, but I wanted to add it here for reference.

The Figma integration would allow the AI to:
- Extract design specifications directly from Figma files
- Generate CSS with exact colors, fonts, and spacing from designs
- Ensure pixel-perfect implementation of UI components
- Maintain design system consistency across the codebase

This tool bridges the gap between design and development, making the AI not just a code generator, but a design-to-code translator that maintains visual fidelity throughout the development process.
